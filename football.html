			<h3>Joao Cancelo's unique role at Man City explained by Pep Guardiola</h3>
			<p><b>ep Guardiola explained the thinking behind Manchester City's tactics at Anfield when speaking to Sky Sports afterwards. “We had to play with a slower rhythm, with more 	passes than usual because they are the best team in the world on transitions."</b>
			It worked. Aside from the penalty, the statistics showed that Liverpool had not created so little in a home Premier League game either this season or last. The 4-1 defeat all but ends Jurgen Klopp's hopes of retaining the title. City are already being hailed as champions elect.Indeed, he has become so fundamental to his coach's thinking that he was substituted just after the hour mark in the previous game at Burnley having been rested completely for the victory over Sheffield United prior to that. Guardiola needed him fresh for Liverpool.
			Ruben Dias is credited with organising the defence, although his error in conceding the penalty showed that even he is fallible. John Stones has improved too. But the biggest reason for City's improvement is the setup. Cancelo's deployment has been crucial to that.
