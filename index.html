							<h3>Rookie Rankings: Ball excels in starting lineup</h3>
							<article class="sec_div_news4_article">
								Another week, another edition of rookie power rankings, and this week's theme seems to be guys who should probably be starting on their team but haven't made that full-time leap yet. The NBA announced the winners for Rookie of the Month, and it went to two guys who have done the majority of their damage coming off the bench. LaMelo Ball won it in the East, and Tyrese Haliburton won it in the West, and even if they hadn't won it, the honors would have likely gone to rookies who are also coming off the bench as Tyrese Maxey was also nominated in the East, as well as Desmond Bane for the West.

								That shows a couple of things about this draft class, first, it's clear teams didn't scout some of these players very well, understandable as the pandemic altered the pre-draft process. It also shows that maybe this draft was deeper than many projected, but not for star power just for solid rotation players.
